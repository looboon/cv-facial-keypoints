<h1>AIND Term II, Computer Vision Capstone Project</h1>

<h1>Facial Keypoint Detection and Real-time Filtering</h1>

Me trying out [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Computer Vision Capstone Project.

Subsequently, I also tried out haar cascades and Histogram of Oriented Gradients using dlib to do facial detection, as well as build a facial recognition pipeline using dlib's powerful libraries.

Finally, I coded a simple but powerful face recognition pipeline using face_recognition library.

Things learnt:
- Use of python's cv2 for object detection and segmentation
- Use of CNNs in Keras to do facial keypoints detection
- Create a pipeline from cv2 object detection and CNN facial keypoint detection
- Run histogram of oriented gradients using dlib
- Build a face recognition pipeline using dlib's HOG face detector, facial landmark estimator and Resnet architecture.
- Use facial_recognition library to run face recognition on a video.

Dependencies
- cv2
- dlib
- [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/) library
- Keras v2.0+
- Tensorflow backend v1.0+
