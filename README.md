<h1>AIND Term II, Computer Vision Capstone Project</h1>

<h1>Facial Keypoint Detection and Real-time Filtering</h1>

Me trying out [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Computer Vision Capstone Project.

Things learnt:
- Use of python's cv2 for object detection and segmentation
- Use of CNNs in Keras to do facial keypoints detection
- Create a pipeline from cv2 object detection and CNN facial keypoint detection
